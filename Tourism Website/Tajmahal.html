                    The Taj Mahal is a world-famous monument located in Agra, India.
                    It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.
                    The monument was built in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
                    It is made entirely of white marble, which changes shades with the sunlight.
                    The Taj Mahal is considered a masterpiece of Mughal architecture.
                    It combines elements of Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian styles.
                    The main structure is surrounded by beautiful gardens and reflecting pools.
                    Its central dome is 73 meters (240 feet) high and flanked by four minarets.
                    Precious and semi-precious stones are inlaid into the marble walls.
                    The Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983.
                    It attracts millions of visitors from around the world each year.
                    It is also regarded as a symbol of eternal love and devotion.
