                    Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, 
                    is a magnificent royal residence located in Mysuru, Karnataka. 
                    It was the seat of the Wadiyar dynasty, who ruled the Kingdom of Mysore for centuries. 
                    The present palace was designed by British architect Henry Irwin and completed in 1912. 
                    Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, it combines elements of Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, 
                    and Gothic architecture. The palace is known for its grand domes, ornate 
                    arches, and beautifully decorated interiors. Inside, visitors can see intricate carvings, 
                    stained glass ceilings, and royal artifacts. The palace is especially famous for its 
                    dazzling illumination during the Dasara festival. Over 100,000 lights light up the structure, 
                    creating a breathtaking view. Mysore Palace is one of the most visited tourist attractions in India. 
                    It stands as a symbol of Karnatakaâ€™s rich cultural and royal heritage.
